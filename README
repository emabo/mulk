To compile you need the following libraries:
libcurl (for Debian try "apt-get install openssl curl libcurl4-openssl-dev" or see http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)
liburiparser (for Debian try "apt-get install liburiparser-dev" or see http://uriparser.sourceforge.net/)

To compile with recursion enabled you need also:
libtidy (for Debian try "apt-get install libtidy-dev" or see http://tidy.sourceforge.net/)

To compile with Metalink enabled you need also:
libmetalink (for Debian try "apt-get install libexpat1-devel libxml2-dev" or see http://launchpad.net/libmetalink/)

To compile with checksum verification for Metalink you need also:
libcrypto (http://www.openssl.org)


To compile the project just type following commands:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

You can also compile mulk's library (libmulk) in static format:

	$ ./configure --disable-shared --enable-static
	$ make
	$ make install

or dynamic format:

	$ ./configure --enable-shared --disable-static
	$ make
	$ make install

By default both of them are compiled in libs/.libs.
